This docuemnt describes the developer setup for working on DropIn. The goal of this
document is have new developers get up and running with a local development
environment on the comptuer / platform of their choice, such that the artifacts
produced can be easily integrated into the production product. 

If you are a developer, please modify this document as necessary whereas correcting
errors, adding platform specific details, or additional detail to help future
developers.

In writing this document I will be making some architecture decisions throughout, and
where I do so I will give a brief diatribe on the reasoning for those decisions.

This document will also describe the setup necessary to colloborate with other devs.

A simple editor is best. We are not writing operating systems or enterprise apps,
Eclipse is probably overkill. I use emacs with the following:

- heavily customized .emacs (see ross-dot-emacs in this directory)
- eclim, company mode, autocomplete, etc

You can use any of the following editors:
- emacs
- sublime
- intellij
- atom
- neovim

Get a proper terminal emulation program as well. (I use iterm2 for mac)

Please make accounts on the following services if you do not already have them: 
hangouts.google.com
gmail.com
drive.google.com
calendar.google.com
github.com
floobits.com
phacility.com
aws.amazon.com
slack.com

Test that you can do the following with another developer:
- can send messages to other team members on slack
- can send a text/chat message with google hangout
- do a google hangout (video/voice) and can share documents
- see another developer's calendar (free/busy) and can book meetings
- can see the shared docs in google drive
- can edit a file colloboratevly with floobits
- can log in to phabracator

Ask me to add or link your account to those things.

Github
------
Clone our git repo (this may move soon)
mkdir ~work
cd ~work
git clone https://github.com/jiadar/dropin.git

Database
--------

Architecture Decision: PostgreSQL
Why: Licensing
Where: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
Version: 9.6.2
Install this on your local machine
Make an admin account

Try to make some databases and/or mess with the database. See the separate doc
database-primer.txt for an exercise to try. 

As postgres you can run this to create a user dropin with password dropinnow

psql -Uyouruser postgres
create role dropin with createdb login password 'dropinnow';
\q

Web Framework 
-------------

Architecture Decision: Rails 
Why: Speed of development 
Where: gorails.com
Version: Ruby 2.4.0, Rails 5.0.1

MAC OSX STEPS... (users of other platforms, please fill in your steps) 
See roughly https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.12-sierra

Install Homebrew
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Install Ruby
brew install rbenv ruby-build
echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
rbenv install 2.4.0
rbenv global 2.4.0
ruby -v

Install Rails
gem install rails -v 5.0.1
rbenv rehash
rails -v

Connect Web Framework to Database
---------------------------------
edit ~/work/dropin/app/config/database.yaml
to have the parameters set up by your database in that step
You have to add password, username, port, etc.. 
see the github config/database.yaml file for my setup

# if you are starting from scratch and not using the git repo
# rails new app -d postgresql

cd app
export PGHOST=localhost
rake db:setup
rails db:migrate
rake db:setup
rails server

Now go to your web browser http://localhost:3000 and you should see the dropin page
(once we actually make it)
